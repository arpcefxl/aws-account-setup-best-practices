#Assuming you already have S3 buckets created, and you'd like to enable
#default SSE using KMS, it is a single command to accomplish.  I've
#included the JSON object so you don't have to figure out the command
#line syntax for embedding JSON directly
#Note that the command uses s3api, NOT s3
aws s3api put-bucket-encryption --cli-input-json file://s3_bucket_encryption.json

#If you'd like to modify the block public access boolean variables, you can do so
#on a per-bucket basis.  The JSON object is included for this as well.
#The default value for all 4 variables is true.
